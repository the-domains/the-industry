So, you have some time on your hands during this holiday season and its time to watch something. But what's it gonna be. A lot of people ask me what shows they should catch up on and i have curated the perfect list for you. Some old, some new, but all worthy!

1\.**The Leftovers**  
Network: HBO  
Number of Seasons: 2  
Number of Episodes: 20 x 1hr

Where can I watch this?  
HBO Go and On Demand. All episodes are available now.

What's so special about this?  
This is a show that most people have not heard of despite it being on HBO. And those that have dipped into the first episode, never returned. But, i can assure you that these two seasons encapsulate a perfect begging middle and end even though there will be a 3rd season next year. 

The first couple of episodes are directed by Peter Berg who kicks of the series in a perfect fly on the wall type of style that can be seen in many of his movies. The acting is top notch, bringing together an great ensemble cast that will have you hooked and guessing.

So, what its about?  
The series takes place 3 years after a "Sudden Departure" in which 2% of the worlds population suddenly disappear without a trace. The premise here, is what happens when the world is in mourning without closure.

2\.**Bloodline**  
Network: Netflix  
Number of Seasons: 1  
Number of Episodes: 13 x 1hr

Where can I watch this?  
Anywhere you want as long as you have a Netflix account. And why not test out that new 4K TV of yours as it is available in 4K!

What's so special about this?  
The cast, the acting and the story pull you in and plays with your emotions all the way through.
